# Teatime

Teatime is a way to stay connected with friends and family over e-mail, but better than e-mail. It's free, private, and respects people. 

Getting a bit more technical, Teatime is an app that runs on your computer or smart phone. It uses your e-mail account to send and receive machine-readable e-mails containing the messages and pictures you are exchanging with friends and family. 

However, instead of just showing you e-mails like any other e-mail program, it loads the messages and pictures contained in these e-mails into a database stored on your computer. It then shows you a convenient user interface to interact with these messages and pictures, much like you would in social networking apps. 

All without using a central server to transmit or store data. Teatime is as peer-to-peer as e-mail is.

The user interface is simple and minimal, and doesn't use [dark patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/) to increase "engagement". Teatime is focused on helping you communicate as mindfully as possible.

## What does this mean?

It means that you neither have to pay for Teatime, nor is your data being sold by Teatime to pay for operating costs (there is nothing to operate). Use it with your existing e-mail account. Teatime developers donate their time to create and maintain Teatime without having to quit their jobs. As a result, Teatime can grow slowly and, at some point, be feature complete.
