# Teatime

Teatime is a way to stay connected with friends and family over e-mail, but better than e-mail. It's free, private, and respects people. 

Getting a bit more technical, Teatime is an app that runs on your computer or smart phone. It uses your e-mail account to send and receive machine-readable e-mails containing the messages and pictures you are exchanging with friends and family. 

Then, instead of just showing you e-mails like any other e-mail program, it loads the messages and pictures contained in these e-mails into a database stored on your computer or smart phone. 

From there, it shows you a convenient user interface to interact with these messages and pictures, much like you would in social networking apps. 

All without using a central Teatime server to transmit or store data. Teatime is as peer-to-peer as e-mail is.

The user interface is simple and minimal, and doesn't use [dark patterns](https://darkpatterns.org/) to increase "engagement". Teatime is focused on helping you communicate as mindfully as possible.

## What does this mean?

It means that you neither have to pay for Teatime, nor is your data being sold by Teatime to pay for operating costs (there is nothing to operate). Use it with your existing e-mail account (maybe create a filter so you don't see the Teatime e-mails in your inbox). Teatime developers donate their time to create and maintain Teatime without having to quit their jobs. As a result, Teatime can grow slowly and, at some point, be [feature complete](http://250bpm.com/blog:50).

## Do we really need another social network?

No, we need less social networks. Teatime is just an app that helps you stay in touch with family and friends. 

## What's the recommended way to use Teatime?

Make yourself a cup of tea. While your tea steeps, turn on your computer. While your computer starts up, gather your thoughts; think about the people who matter most to you. Start the Teatime app; it will download updates from your e-mail account. Start reading your updates! Have your tea and respond to your updates as you go. Is there someone you haven't been in touch with for a while? Send them an update! When you're all done, tell Teatime to send out all of your updates. Close the Teatime app. Shut down your computer. Think about how and when you're going to see your family and friends in person. Now go spend some time outside, ideally with friends or family! Bonus: leave your cell phone at home!
